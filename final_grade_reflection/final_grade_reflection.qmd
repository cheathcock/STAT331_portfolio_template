#### What grade did you earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.

I believe I earned an A in this class. I have demonstrated proficiency for the majority of the learning targets, as described below. I have completed all of the assignments, and although I have not submitted all of them on time, I submitted most of them in a timely manner. I have revised my code whenever I have gotten a chance, and have continued to revise my code for the portfolio. I have learned from my past revisions and applied my new skills to subsequent assignments. I have put full effort into the challenge assignments, extending my thinking regularly. I have been willing to try different approaches, and have learned a lot in the process. I have also been a very collaborative group member. I often communicate with my team and facilitate conversations. I have also put my best effort into reviewing my peers' code, and have given criticism with kindness. 

#### How did you meet that grade's requirements? The requirements for grades are found in the Are there "guidelines" for how I should award myself a grade? section of the syllabus. Review the criteria carefully. Then, explain how you have satisfied the criteria for the grade you are saying you've earned. Be specific and thorough. List each criterion you have met and how you know you've met it. Refer to specific artifacts or examples in the Portfolio that support your case. Again, keep it brief and focused on concrete evidence that the criteria have been met.

In the working with data category, I have mastered all of the learning targets. Proof for WD-1 can be found in Lab 3, Practice Activity 4, and Practice Activity 5.1. Evidence of WD-2 can be found in Lab 3 on number 7. Evidence of WD-3 can be found in Lab 3 under "Study Subjects". Evidence of WD-4 can be found in Lab 3 on number 4, and in Lab 5 in number 3 in the third section. WD-5 can be found in Lab 4 under number 2. Evidence of WD-6 can also be found in Lab 4 In the"Dataset Cleaning" section. WD-7 can be found in Lab 9 under part 3 number 1. In the Reproducibility category, I have achieved R-1, shown in Lab 3, as well as R-2, shown in Lab 9. R-3 can be shown in Lab 8 in number 1, Singing the Song. In the data visualization and summarization category, I have achieved all the learning targets. Evidence for DVS-1 can be found throughout Lab 2. DVS-2 can also be found in Lab 5, number 3. DVS-3 can be found in Lab 5 in the last couple graphs. DVS-4 can be found in Lab 3, number 7. DVS-5 can be found in Lab 9 in part 3, number 2. As for program efficiency, I have mastered PE-1 and PE-2, as shown in Lab 8. PE-3 is shown in Lab 7, under Part one, Task 2. PE-4 is shown throughout each of my assignments, but specifically in Lab 5. As for Data Simulation and Modeling, I have achieved DSM-2, which can be found in Lab 9 under part 4, number 7. 

#### What else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that isn't explicitly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria you're thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus criteria, be focused, specific, and thorough --- and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.

I have worked hard to be successful in this class beyond the expectations outlined for us in the syllabus. I have attended every class (other than when I had COVID) and have been present and engaged. I have attended office hours often to clarify concepts. I have found solutions for various problems using a variety of resources. Additionally, I have applied the concepts we learned to different classes, specifically the tidyverse and its various tools and formats. ((((evidence in the artifacts))))
