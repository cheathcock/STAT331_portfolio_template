#### What grade did you earn? 

I believe I earned an A in this class. I have demonstrated proficiency for the majority of the learning targets, as described below. I have completed all of the assignments, and although I have not submitted all of them on time, I submitted most of them in a timely manner. I have revised my code whenever I have gotten a chance, and have continued to revise my code for the portfolio. I appreciate that I have been able to build on my initial understanding of the class curriculum by going back to my past work and revising my thinking, as well as being able to apply the concepts in various contexts, and apply new skills to subsequent assignments. I have put full effort into the challenge assignments, extending my thinking regularly. I have been willing to try different approaches to different problems, and have learned a lot in the process. I have also contributed to creating a respectful classroom learning community through my participation and engagement during class and office hours. I have also been a very collaborative group member. I often communicate with my team and facilitate conversations. I have also put my best effort into reviewing my peers' code, and have given criticism with kindness. Additionally, I feel like I have achieved the goals I set out for myself at the beginning of the quarter. I have kept up with all the coursework, for the most part, and understand what is expected from me in the context of this class. I have also grown so much as a programmer this quarter and feel like I am ready to tackle my next goal-- writing applicable code for all different sorts of applications. After taking this class, I have developed the necessary skills to write useful code for different contexts.

#### How did you meet that grade's requirements? 

In the working with data category, I have mastered all of the learning targets. Proof for WD-1 can be found in Lab 3, Practice Activity 4, and Practice Activity 5.1, all different formats of uploading data. Evidence of WD-2 can be found in Lab 3 on number 7. Evidence of WD-3 can be found in Lab 3 under "Study Subjects\". Evidence of WD-4 can be found in Lab 3 on number 4, and in Lab 5 in number 3 in the third section, two different modifications of different kinds of variables. WD-5 can be found in Lab 4 under number 2. Evidence of WD-6 can also be found in Lab 4 In the "Dataset Cleaning" section. WD-7 can be found in Lab 9 under part 3 number 1. In the Reproducibility category, I have achieved R-1, shown in Lab 3, at the very top of the document. I have also completed R-2, shown in Lab 9, part 3, number 3, where I create a plot following the tidyverse guidelines. R-3 can be shown in Lab 7 in Part 2, task 2, where we implemented function stops into our function. In the data visualization and summarization category, I have achieved all the learning targets. Evidence for DVS-1 can be found throughout Lab 2, in numbers 4, 7, and 11. Evidence of DVS-2 can be found in Lab 5, number 3. DVS-3 can be found in Lab 5 in the last couple graphs, where I changed the color of the graphs. DVS-4 can be found in Lab 3, number 7. DVS-5 can be found in Lab 9 in part 3, number 2. DVS-6 can be found in Challenge 9, in part 3, number 1, where I used the Kable package to create nice-looking tables. DVS-7 can also be found in Challenge 9, in part 5, numbers 2 and 3, where we created tables for the \'Allen\' data. As for program efficiency, I have mastered PE-1 and PE-2, as shown in Lab 8, in the code chunk named \"pluralization\" . PE-3 is shown in Lab 7, under Part one, Task 2. PE-4 is shown throughout each of my assignments, but specifically in Lab 7, Part 2, task 2, where I use the pipeline operator efficiently. As for Data Simulation and Modeling, I have achieved DSM-1, which can be found in Practice Activity 9 in the code chunk named \"data-simulation\", as well as DSM-2, which can be found in Lab 9 under part 4, number 7.Â 

#### What else? 

I have worked hard to be successful in this class beyond the expectations outlined for us in the syllabus. I have attended every class (other than when I had COVID) and have been present and engaged. I have attended office hours often to clarify concepts. I have developed my critical thinking skills and troubleshooting techniques through various resources, like the help file and stack overflow, as well as the discord channel. I have worked so hard to not only keep up with the class content, but understand every concept outlined. Additionally, I have applied the concepts we learned to different classes, specifically the tidyverse and its various tools and formats. These are all somewhat general accomplishments, which are hard to cite with one artifact. But Challenge 9 is a pretty good representation of how far I\'ve come in this class, especially compared to the earlier labs. In Challenge 9, I used various troubleshooting techniques to figure out how to make my tables look nice, and also updated my YAML to create a nicer-looking document.
