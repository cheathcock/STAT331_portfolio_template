#### What learning targets have you demonstrated an understanding of?

In the working with data category, I have mastered all of the learning targets. Proof for WD-1 can be found in Lab 3, Practice Activity 4, and Practice Activity 5.1. Evidence of WD-2 can be found in Lab 3 on number 7. Evidence of WD-3 can be found in Lab 3 under "Study Subjects", as well as in Practice Activity 5. Evidence of WD-4 can be found in Lab 3 on number 4, and in Lab 5 in number 3 in the third section. WD-5 can be found in Lab 4 under number 2. Evidence of WD-6 can also be found in Lab 4 In the "Dataset Cleaning" section. In the Reproducibility category, I have achieved R-1, shown in Lab 3, as well as R-2, shown in Practice activity 5. In the data visualization and summarization category, I have achieved all the learning targets. Evidence for DVS-1 can be found throughout Lab 2. DVS-2 can also be found in Lab 2, as well as Lab 5. DVS-3 can be found in Lab 5 in the last couple graphs, where I changed the color of the graphs. DVS-4 can be found in Lab 3, number 7. DVS-5 can be found in Challenge 3. As for program efficiency, I have mastered PE-1, as shown in Lab 4, as well as PE-2, as shown in Practice Activity 5. PE-4 is shown throughout each of my assignments, but specifically in Lab 5.

#### How have you demonstrated a commitment to continued learning?

I have demonstrated a commitment to continued learning through my dedication to understand my past mistakes. I spend a fair amount of time completing the initial assignments for this class, but oftentimes I am not able to perfect them the first time around. However, I think there is so much value in receiving feedback, and developing my initial attempt at a solution. Additionally, I am able to reinforce class concepts within the structure of class and office hours. The in-person meetings allow me to develop my thinking and really let the concepts click. I appreciate that I am able to build on my initial understanding of the class curriculum by going back to my past work and revising my thinking, as well as being able to apply the concepts in various contexts.

#### How have you grown as a team member and leader?

I have grown as a team member through my communication and collaboration skills. It is nice to have a support system to assist with small issues I often encounter while coding, as well as big picture concepts. I have become much more comfortable communicating with my team about various assignments and issues. Additionally, I am always happy to help out my team members if they are confused about something that I understand. In terms of the ways I have grown within my team, I think I have developed as a team member and leader. I always try to make sure the members of our team are on the same page, and facilitate a group conversation if it needs to be had. I also feel like I have grown as a leader, in the sense that I have developed various troubleshooting techniques for when I encounter issues, like using the help file and stack overflow, as well as checking the discord channel.

#### How have you contributed to creating a respectful classroom learning community?

I have contributed to creating a respectful classroom learning community through my participation and engagement during class. I really appreciate the dynamic of the STAT 331 classroom, because I feel very comfortable asking questions, as well as collaborating with the people around me. It is a very inclusive and low-stakes environment, so I feel quite comfortable participating in class discussions.

#### Are you accomplishing the goals you outlined for yourself at the start of the course?

The first goal I outlined for myself at the start of the class was to thoroughly understand what is expected from me and keep up with the workload of the class. Unfortunately, I don't think I have fully achieved this first goal. I feel as though I understand what is expected of me and I understand the flow and workload of the class. However, I have not been the best at keeping up with all of our assignments. Around week 4-5, I got quite behind on the coursework. This was quite frustrating when attempting activities in class, as I felt very behind and lost. However, I am proud of myself for rebounding from this self-imposed setback and catching up the following weekend. Instead of wallowing in my stressed state of being, I dedicated time to learning the concepts that I had not grasped. My goal for the rest of the quarter is to keep up with the outlined concepts and stay on top of the workload. My second goal outlined at the start of the course was to creatively write R code that is useful in all sorts of applications. I can't say I have fully achieved this, as I think I have a lot of room for improvement as a programmer, and this is quite a broad goal. However, I think I am working in the right direction. Since I wrote the last reflection, I feel as though I have developed my coding skills a lot and I am able to confidently say I have achieved many more of the learning targets. Although I have not fully achieved the goals I outlined for myself, I feel confident in my ability to achieve them by the end of the quarter. I feel as though I deserve a B+ for my work in the class. I don't think I have quite crossed the threshold into the A range, especially since I was behind for a little while. However, I have confidence that by the end of the quarter, I will be able to demonstrate proficiency in the majority of the learning targets. In terms of revising my thinking, I think I have regularly learned from my revisions, which has impacted my code in subsequent assignments, and I have revised all of the assignments when the opportunity is given. I have also extended my thinking by completing most of the challenge assignments and challenging myself within the context of these problems. I hope to challenge myself even more throughout the remainder of the quarter. I also think I have been a great team member. I am good at encouraging communication within my team and will ask Dr. T. questions when necessary. I am always present and cooperative, I always fill my role in the team, and I always try to be as respectful as possible. I think I am adequately prepared for class each week, however, I have not been consistent about completing assignments and quizzes on time. In terms of peer-reviewing code, I think I have been responsive to constructive criticism, and have put my best effort into reviewing my peers' code. For the code I have reviewed, I have given constructive criticism with kindness, as well as praised good qualities of other's code.
